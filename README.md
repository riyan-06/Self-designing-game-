 Save The Earth Game 

Goal of the Game : Using the G-240 fighter plane , fire missiles and destroy the 100 fast moving asteroids which are coming towards earth.

Story : It is the year 2085 and Earth is on the brink of extinction. Giant Asteroids from outer space are coming towards Earth. You are one of the best space force pilot and were given the G-240 fighter plane to save humanity. You must destroy the 100 asteroids by firing the Guren MK2 missiles. The shapes and sizes of these asteroids are very unique and you must shoot accordingly. It's a Do or Die.

Playing Characters : The G-240 fighter plane and the Guren MK2 missiles.

What can these characters do : You are the pilot of the G-240 plane and have control of the plane. You can move the plane left or right. The Guren MK2 are the missiles which you are going to fire  in order to destroy the asteroids.

Non Playing Character : The Asteroids.

What can this character do : The asteroids are your enemy. They can come in different speeds , shapes and sizes and can destroy your plane and earth.

How do you plan to make your game more engaging : Not all asteroids will have the same speed , direction , shape and size. Asteroids would start coming faster and smaller which would make it harder for the player to shoot it. There would also be record of how many asteroids the player has destroyed. Once the player destroys 100 asteroids he would win the game and hence save the earth. There will also be a background audio which would make it more engaging for the player.
